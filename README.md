# About project

The idea is make template which I'm able to use in the future. It contains some popular solutions like create-react-app, ts, cypress, mui etc...

Features:
1. create-react-app
2. cypress - imo it's better to use image snaphots testing from small pages
3. mui - material design rules of making websites are so awesome! It helps to create UI and make work faster.
4. semantic release - every fix/feat/BREAKING is released
5. dependabot - to have fresh dependencies
